# Conditions for reuse

- Unless otherwise stated, the information on this website is free of rights and may be used for private, association, scientific and commercial purposes. The federal government does, however, recommend stating the source and date of the information that is reused.
- Where prior authorisation is required, or where specific conditions are necessary, re-use restrictions are explicitly mentioned. The re-use of multimedia content (photographs, images, sound, videos, etc.), including the content contained in downloadable documents (brochures, etc.), is always subject to prior approval.
- The federal government makes every effort to ensure that this website is correct and up to date. Should an error be detected, it undertakes to make the necessary corrections as soon as possible.

More information on access to and re-use of government information can be found at [data.gov.be (in French)](https://data.gov.be/fr/aspects-legaux-et-avis).
